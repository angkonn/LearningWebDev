Different display tag types in html: 
  

1. Block-Level Elements
Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available. They can contain other block-level or inline elements. Common block-level elements include:
<div>
<h1> to <h6> (header tags)
<p> (paragraph)
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
<article>
<nav>


2. Inline Elements
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They can contain text and other inline elements but cannot contain block-level elements. Common inline elements include:
<span>
<a>
<img>
<strong>
<em>


3. Inline-Block Elements
These elements are formatted as inline elements but can have width and height applied to them. They sit inline with other content but behave like block elements in terms of sizing. Examples include:
<button>
<input>
<select>
<textarea>


4. Other Display Types
There are several other display values that can be used to control how an element is rendered:
flex: Displays an element as a block-level flex container.
grid: Displays an element as a block-level grid container.
table: Displays an element as a block-level table.
none: The element is completely removed from the document layout.
contents: Makes the container disappear, making its child elements children of the next level up in the DOM.
